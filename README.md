# area-type-determination
This project is an educational machine learning project that focuses on text classification.
It predicts whether a given place name belongs to a business or residential area based on language patterns found in real-world location data.

The project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of building a classifier — from dataset preparation and labeling to model training and evaluation. It uses a JSON dataset of place names and explores how linguistic features can be used to infer the functional type of a geographic area.

This repository is designed as a learning example for those who want to understand how machine learning can be applied to natural language data and geographic context.
